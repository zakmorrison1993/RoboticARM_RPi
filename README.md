# RoboticARM_RPi-Python

This project uses a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+	(2.5A)


Currently this doesn't work!

There are inconsistencies with code and schematics!!


Example of:

- Use of libraries

- Loop 'For' statements

- RPi knowledge

- Basic circuitry knowledge



Appendix A: First example build - Failed :

Critism of Appendix A:

- This was my first (robotic) python script

- Structural integrity made from cardboard - not good

- Ampage too powerful for RP 3+ more suited for RP 4

- No hand, difficulty develop structure.

- Rushed project



APPEDNIX B: Second Hand Build - To be Completed :
